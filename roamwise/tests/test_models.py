"""The two "tools" the proposal names, on their own: the Holt-Winters demand
model that flags crowding, and the KMeans segmenter that turns six sliders
into an archetype.

Split out of `test_retrieval.py` in #164. They were folded in there by #150 and
they never belonged: they test `models/`, and leaving them beside the retrieval
tests put two people in one file.
